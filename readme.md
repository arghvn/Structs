Struct and its difference with Class:
Structs are a volume style alternative to classes.
  So when we want to quantify many copies of a data, we use Struct.
Each member of the structure can take on different characteristics.
The difference between struct and class is between their default permissions;
 In the class, the corresponding member has private access by default, and in struct, it is defined as public access.
